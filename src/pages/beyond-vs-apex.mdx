			# Celebrity Beyond vs. Celebrity Apex — Ship Comparison

			Both Celebrity Beyond (2022) and Celebrity Apex (2020) are Edge Class sister ships sharing the same DNA: Magic Carpet, Infinite Verandas, four themed main dining rooms, and Celebrity's signature relaxed-luxury vibe. But Beyond was deliberately designed as an evolution — 65 feet longer, one deck taller, and refined in ways that matter. Here's what's actually different.

			---

			## Size & Capacity

			| | **Celebrity Apex** | **Celebrity Beyond** |
			|---|---|---|
			| **Year Built** | 2020 (renovated 2025) | 2022 |
			| **Gross Tonnage** | ~129,500 GT | ~140,600 GT |
			| **Length** | ~1,004 ft | ~1,073 ft (+65 ft) |
			| **Passenger Decks** | 16 | 17 |
			| **Double Occupancy** | ~2,910 | ~3,260 |
			| **Staterooms** | ~1,467 | ~1,646 (+179) |

			Despite carrying more passengers, Beyond's extra tonnage gives it a comparable space ratio — much of the added length went into expanding public areas rather than just packing in more cabins.

			---

			## Martini Bar

			This is one of the most talked-about differences between the two ships.

			On **Apex**, the Martini Bar is tucked into a corner of the Grand Plaza atrium. It's a popular spot, but the compact layout means it gets packed quickly and can be hard to grab a drink during peak hours.

			On **Beyond**, the Martini Bar was completely reimagined as a full circular bar positioned front and center under a dramatic LED chandelier. The redesigned Grand Plaza feels significantly more open and airy, and the bar becomes the natural hub of nightlife activity rather than a cramped afterthought.

			## Sunset Bar

			The single biggest design upgrade on Beyond. On **Apex**, the aft-facing Sunset Bar is notably small — multiple reviewers describe it as underwhelming and more of an afterthought than a destination venue.

			On **Beyond**, the Sunset Bar was redesigned by Celebrity ambassador Nate Berkus into a multi-terraced, Moroccan-inspired lounge that is roughly 180% larger than the Apex version. It spans multiple levels with elevated wings, bronze accents, tiled green backsplash, and a covered pergola entrance. It's consistently cited as one of the best spots on the ship.

			## Bars & Lounges

			Beyond has approximately 3 more bars than Apex. The most notable addition:

			- **World Class Bar** — A craft cocktail venue making its Edge Series debut on Beyond. This bar originated on Celebrity's Solstice Class ships and was brought back for Beyond, featuring bespoke cocktails with fresh ingredients. It sits in the Grand Plaza area and serves as a great pre-dinner stop. This venue does not exist on Apex.

			Both ships share: Craft Social, Café al Bacio, Eden Bar, Pool Bar, Magic Carpet bar, The Retreat Lounge bar, and Il Secondo Bacio.

			---

			## Pool Deck & Outdoor Spaces

			Beyond's Resort Deck has roughly 40% more space than Apex's version. Key differences:

			- **Cantilevered pool** — Beyond added an infinity-style pool that extends out over the side of the ship, which quickly became one of the most popular spots onboard. Apex does not have this.
			- **More pools & hot tubs** — Beyond has more of both, including additional exclusive-access options.
			- **Rooftop Garden** — The extra length gives the Rooftop Garden more breathing room. Alcoves were moved to the perimeter, freeing the center for backyard games and movie screenings.

			---

			## The Retreat (Suite Experience)

			Both ships offer The Retreat with its private sundeck, lounge, and exclusive restaurant. But Beyond made upgrades:

			- **Luminae** was relocated to the front of the ship with panoramic floor-to-ceiling ocean views (on Apex it's positioned differently without the same forward views).
			- **New suite categories** on Beyond include two-story Edge Villas with private plunge pools — not available on Apex.

			---

			## Dining

			The core restaurant lineup is nearly identical across both ships. Both have the four complimentary main dining rooms (Cyprus, Normandie, Tuscan, Cosmopolitan), plus Eden, Fine Cut Steakhouse, Raw on 5, Le Grand Bistro / Le Petit Chef, Rooftop Garden Grill, Blu, Luminae, Eden Café, Mast Grill, Oceanview Café, and Spa Café.

			Beyond has roughly one more dining venue overall (20 vs. 19) and about one more paid option (12 vs. 11). The menus across the main dining rooms are standardized across the Edge Class.

			---

			## Entertainment

			- **The Club** (cabaret/nightclub) on Beyond added windows along the edge, brightening the space during the day — a small but welcome improvement.
			- **Eden entertainment** was toned down on Beyond compared to earlier Edge ships, moving away from the more in-your-face interactive performances to something more approachable.
			- Both ships feature the same Theatre productions and Stage Door performances.

			---

			## Bottom Line

			If you're choosing between these two ships, the core experience — dining, staterooms, service, Magic Carpet, Infinite Verandas — is essentially the same. Where Beyond pulls ahead is in the **bar scene** (especially the Martini Bar, Sunset Bar, and addition of World Class Bar) and **outdoor spaces** (larger pool deck, cantilevered pool, more spacious Rooftop Garden). The redesigned Grand Plaza also gives Beyond a noticeably more open, grand feeling.

			That said, Apex was renovated in 2025, and itinerary should be a major factor — Apex frequently sails Northern Europe and the Mediterranean, while Beyond has different seasonal deployments. Pick the itinerary you love and know you'll have a great time on either ship.
