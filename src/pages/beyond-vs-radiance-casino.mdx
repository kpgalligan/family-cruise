			# Casino Comparison: Celebrity Beyond vs. Royal Caribbean Radiance of the Seas

			Two very different casino philosophies from two sister cruise lines (both under Royal Caribbean Group). Celebrity Beyond offers a premium, fully smoke-free casino experience, while Radiance of the Seas just underwent a significant casino expansion in February 2026 that added a dedicated non-smoking casino — but kept smoking in the main one.

			## Slot Machines

			**Celebrity Beyond** has approximately **276 slot machines** with player tracking. Slots start at $0.01 and include reel slots, video bonus games, and video poker machines. Cashless wagering is available via SeaPass card, with a daily maximum of $5,000 on slots. The casino also hosts slot tournaments with cash prizes up to $15,000 for the top finisher.

			**Radiance of the Seas** has approximately **188 slot machines** across its casino spaces. Traditionally these accepted real quarters (getting tokens from the cashier was optional), though the fleet has been modernizing to cashless systems. With the February 2026 drydock, some slot machines were moved into the new non-smoking casino space that replaced the Quill & Compass Pub, so the total slot count across both casino areas may have shifted. The new non-smoking section includes slots and some table games, though reports indicate that space was still being fully set up as of mid-February 2026.

			For dedicated slot players, Beyond offers roughly **47% more machines** in a single, unified smoke-free floor. Radiance splits its smaller inventory across two separate spaces.

			## Smoking Policy

			This is the most significant difference between these two casinos and arguably the deciding factor for many cruisers.

			### Celebrity Beyond — Fully Smoke-Free

			Celebrity Cruises operates a **100% smoke-free casino policy fleet-wide**. No exceptions, no smoking sections, no designated smoking slots. This has been Celebrity's stance for years, and by all accounts the casinos remain well-attended despite (or because of) the policy. Multiple cruisers report that Celebrity's smoke-free casinos are consistently packed, debunking the industry myth that smokers drive casino revenue.

			This means on Beyond, you can spend hours at the slots or tables without worrying about smoke odor on your clothes, secondhand smoke exposure, or ventilation quality. The adjacent Craft Social Bar is also smoke-free.

			### Radiance of the Seas — Smoking Allowed + New Non-Smoking Casino

			Royal Caribbean's policy is more complex and has been actively evolving:

			**Main Casino Royale (Deck 6):** Smoking is **permitted for active players** — meaning you must be seated and playing. Smoking is not allowed at the casino bar or when the casino is closed. In practice, enforcement is inconsistent, and the smoke permeates the space. The "non-smoking section" within the main casino is largely ineffective since there's no physical barrier.

			**New Non-Smoking Casino (formerly Quill & Compass Pub):** As of February 2026, Royal Caribbean replaced the pub with a **dedicated non-smoking casino**. This new space is connected to the main casino on two ends but has a corridor in between to provide some separation. It has its own dedicated bar (repurposed from the former pub bar), slot machines, and some table games. This is part of Royal Caribbean's fleet-wide trend of adding secondary non-smoking casino spaces — similar conversions have happened on Oasis Class ships (replacing Jazz on 4) and Freedom of the Seas (replacing Vintages wine bar).

			**Important caveats for the Radiance non-smoking casino:**
			- It is significantly smaller than the main Casino Royale
			- The corridor separation may not fully prevent smoke drift from the adjacent main casino
			- The conversion eliminated the Quill & Compass Pub, which was a popular entertainment venue with live music — that entertainment has not been confirmed as relocated
			- Smoking is not permitted in the casino on sailings departing from Australia or the United Kingdom

			## Table Games

			**Celebrity Beyond** offers a wide variety: Blackjack, Single Deck Blackjack, Roulette, 3-Card Poker, Craps, Ultimate Texas Hold 'Em, and Electronic Pokermate (Texas Hold 'Em). Lotto is also available. Baccarat and Let It Ride are available by request. Blackjack minimums typically range from $10–$25, with tables at $25+ more likely to offer the traditional 3:2 payout.

			**Radiance of the Seas** has approximately 11 gaming tables plus a VIP poker room for high-stakes players. Available games include Craps, Roulette, Blackjack 21, and Caribbean Stud Poker. Poker machines are also available. The VIP poker room is a feature Beyond does not specifically advertise.

			## Loyalty Programs & Perks

			**Celebrity Beyond** runs the **Blue Chip Club** program. Members accumulate points based on casino spend and receive perks including complimentary casino drinks, cocktail party invitations, and even free Celebrity cruises. Blue Chip Club tiers (Onyx, Amethyst, Sapphire, Sapphire Plus, Ruby) unlock additional benefits like waived cashless wagering convenience fees. Tournament entrants may receive complimentary rounds or discounted buy-ins.

			**Radiance of the Seas** participates in Royal Caribbean's **Casino Royale** rewards program, which is one of the more aggressive casino loyalty programs in the cruise industry. High-volume players report frequent offers for complimentary and discounted cruises. Royal Caribbean has been notably expanding its casino footprint fleet-wide, suggesting the program is a significant revenue and loyalty driver.

			## The Trade-Off

			The casino choice between these ships largely comes down to priorities:

			**Choose Celebrity Beyond if** you want a completely smoke-free casino experience with a larger slot floor (276 machines), a more premium/quieter atmosphere, and you don't need a VIP poker room. The smoke-free policy is absolute and fleet-wide — no ambiguity.

			**Choose Radiance of the Seas if** you're a smoker who wants to play and smoke simultaneously in the main casino, or if you value the new non-smoking casino option and don't mind a smaller overall slot inventory. The new dedicated non-smoking space is a step in the right direction, but it's smaller and the physical separation from the smoking casino may not be complete. Note that the pub entertainment was lost in the conversion.
