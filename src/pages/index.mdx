      ## Our Baseline: The Irish Cruise

      | | Irish Cruise (Princess) |
      |---|---|
      | Cabin (2-person balcony) | $4,552 |
      | Drinks package | Included |
      | Wi-Fi | Included |
      | Gratuities | Included |
      | **Total all-in price** | **$4,552** |
      | Deposit | Refundable |

      ---

      ## How Pricing Works

      **Celebrity Cruises** prices are "Always Included" — drinks, Wi-Fi, and gratuities are bundled in. The price you see is the all-in price.

      **Royal Caribbean** prices include the cabin and gratuities only. Drinks and Wi-Fi must be purchased separately after booking. We estimate ~$600/person ($1,200 for two) as a worst case, based on what Celebrity charges for equivalent packages. However, Royal Caribbean frequently runs sales through their app, so the actual cost could be significantly less. You can't purchase drink/Wi-Fi packages until after you reserve the trip.

      **Refundable deposits** are available on all options for ~$400 per room (not per person). The deposit itself is $500 for all Royal Caribbean and Celebrity options. Without the refundable upgrade, you can still change your booking to a different cruise, but there's a $100 per person fee to do so. So everyone would need to decide: pay ~$400 upfront for full flexibility, or save that money knowing you can still rebook for $200 (for two guests) if plans change.

      ## The Options

      ### Option 1: Celebrity Beyond — Grand Cayman, Mexico & Bahamas (7 Nights)

      [View on Celebrity Cruises →](https://www.celebritycruises.com/itinerary/7-night-grand-cayman-mexico-bahamas-from-fort-lauderdale-on-celebrity-BY07W721?sailDate=2027-02-07&packageCode=BY07W721&groupId=BY07FLL-3873947902&country=USA)

			[Deck Plan →](https://www.cruisemapper.com/deckplans/Celebrity-Beyond-1690)

      **Ship:** Celebrity Beyond · Edge Series (2022) · 3,260 guests

      **Price:** $3,972.98 (all-in: drinks, Wi-Fi, gratuities included)

      **Dates:** Feb 7–14, 2027

      **Departure:** Fort Lauderdale, FL

      | Day | Port |
      |-----|------|
      | 1 (Feb 7) | Fort Lauderdale, FL — departs 4:00 PM |
      | 2 (Feb 8) | Bimini, Bahamas |
      | 3 (Feb 9) | Sea Day |
      | 4 (Feb 10) | Grand Cayman |
      | 5 (Feb 11) | Cozumel, Mexico |
      | 6 (Feb 12) | Costa Maya, Mexico |
      | 7 (Feb 13) | Sea Day |
      | 8 (Feb 14) | Fort Lauderdale, FL — arrives 7:00 AM |

      **4 ports · 2 sea days**

      The newest ship in this comparison (2022). Same Edge Series as the Apex but two years newer. Four ports with only two sea days — the most time ashore of the 7-night options. Costa Maya is a quieter Mexican port with Mayan ruins and less commercialization than Cozumel.

      **Estimated all-in cost:**

      | | Cost |
      |--|------|
      | Cabin (all-in) | $3,973 |
      | + Refundable deposit | ~$4,373 |

      **TL;DR — A mix of ship and ports.** Newest ship, most ports of the 7-night options. Nearly identical price to Option 2 ($17 more), but a slightly newer ship and one extra port. Best pick if you want more time ashore on a modern ship.

      ### Option 2: Celebrity Apex — Key West, Mexico & Cayman (7 Nights)

      [View on Celebrity Cruises →](https://www.celebritycruises.com/itinerary/7-night-key-west-mexico-cayman-from-orlando-port-canaveral-on-celebrity-AX07W681?sailDate=2027-02-06&packageCode=AX07W681&groupId=AX07PCN-3204016261&country=USA)

			[Deck Plan →](https://www.cruisemapper.com/deckplans/Celebrity-Apex-1587)

      **Ship:** Celebrity Apex · Edge Series (2020) · 2,910 guests

      **Price:** $3,956.08 (all-in: drinks, Wi-Fi, gratuities included)

      **Dates:** Feb 6–13, 2027

      **Departure:** Port Canaveral, FL

      | Day | Port |
      |-----|------|
      | 1 (Feb 6) | Port Canaveral, FL — departs 3:30 PM |
      | 2 (Feb 7) | Key West, FL |
      | 3 (Feb 8) | Sea Day |
      | 4 (Feb 9) | Grand Cayman |
      | 5 (Feb 10) | Sea Day |
      | 6 (Feb 11) | Cozumel, Mexico |
      | 7 (Feb 12) | Sea Day |
      | 8 (Feb 13) | Port Canaveral, FL — arrives 7:00 AM |

      **3 ports · 3 sea days**

      Edge Series ships are Celebrity's newest line — Infinite Verandas (convertible indoor/outdoor balcony), modern design, excellent dining. Key West is a unique, walkable port that's very different from typical island stops.

      **Estimated all-in cost:**

      | | Cost |
      |--|------|
      | Cabin (all-in) | $3,956 |
      | + Refundable deposit | ~$4,356 |

      **TL;DR — A mix of ship and ports.** Modern ship, solid western Caribbean itinerary. ~$600 less than the Irish cruise before the refundable deposit, ~$200 less with it.

      ### Option 3: Royal Caribbean — Western Caribbean (8 Nights)

      [View on Royal Caribbean →](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/itinerary/8-night-western-caribbean-cruise-from-tampa-on-radiance-RD08W068?sailDate=2027-02-06&packageCode=RD08W068&groupId=RD08TPA-50893580&country=USA)

			[Deck Plan →](https://www.cruisemapper.com/deckplans/Radiance-Of-The-Seas-563)

      **Ship:** Radiance of the Seas · Radiance Class (2001, refurbished 2026) · ~2,140 guests

      **Price:** $2,647.60 (cabin + gratuities — drinks & Wi-Fi NOT included)

      **Dates:** Feb 6–14, 2027

      **Departure:** Tampa, FL

      | Day | Port |
      |-----|------|
      | 1 (Feb 6) | Tampa, FL — departs 4:00 PM |
      | 2 (Feb 7) | Sea Day |
      | 3 (Feb 8) | Costa Maya, Mexico |
      | 4 (Feb 9) | Roatan, Honduras |
      | 5 (Feb 10) | Belize City, Belize |
      | 6 (Feb 11) | Sea Day |
      | 7 (Feb 12) | Grand Cayman |
      | 8 (Feb 13) | Sea Day |
      | 9 (Feb 14) | Tampa, FL — arrives 7:00 AM |

      **4 ports · 3 sea days**

      Radiance is an older, smaller ship. Recently refurbished (Feb 2026), so it should be in good shape, but it won't have the bells and whistles of newer ships. This option is about the ports, not the ship. Roatan and Belize are unique stops you won't find on most Caribbean itineraries.

      **Estimated all-in cost:**

      | | Low | Mid | High |
      |--|-----|-----|------|
      | Cabin + gratuities | $2,648 | $2,648 | $2,648 |
      | Drinks + Wi-Fi (2 guests) | ~$600 | ~$900 | ~$1,200 |
      | **Subtotal** | **~$3,248** | **~$3,548** | **~$3,848** |
      | + Refundable deposit | ~$3,648 | ~$3,948 | ~$4,248 |

      **TL;DR — This option is about the ports, not the ship.** 8 nights with unique Central American stops (Roatan, Belize). The base price is the cheapest by far, and even at worst case for drinks/Wi-Fi, it's well under the Irish cruise.
